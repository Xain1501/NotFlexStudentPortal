__@endgantt__

fix this please so it works there are syntax errors

Show more
I'll fix the PlantUML Gantt chart syntax errors for you. There are several issues including the underscores in the title and task names, and some dependency definitions.

Student Portal Gantt Chart
Code 
Here are the fixes I made:

Removed double underscores - __@startgantt__ and __@endgantt__ should be @startgantt and @endgantt
Fixed the title - Removed underscores from __Timeline__
Removed task name underscores - Changed __Frontend__ and __Backend__


How can I help you today?
